// In-engine mesh fracturing -- the real replacement for the standalone
// throwaway blast_test_gen.cpp tool this whole Blast effort prototyped with.
// Ports that tool's proven-correct authoring call sequence
// (NvBlastExtAuthoringCreateFractureTool -> VoronoiSitesGenerator ->
// voronoiFracturing -> NvBlastExtAuthoringProcessFracture) into real module
// code, using the module's own PxPhysics (GodotPhysXServer3D) to cook
// collision hulls instead of a standalone PxCreatePhysics call.
//
// A RefCounted rather than a set of static functions so it's directly
// callable from GDScript (ClassDB.instantiate("PhysXBlastAuthoring")) for a
// headless test today, and so a future editor dock has an obvious object to
// hold onto without inventing a second calling convention.

	// NvBlastExtAuthoring's FractureTool supports more than one fracture
	// algorithm -- PATTERN_VORONOI (organic/rock-like chunks, the original
	// only option), PATTERN_SLICING (regular, brick-like pieces from cutting
	// planes -- much better suited to man-made/architectural shapes like
	// crates or walls than Voronoi's random cells), and PATTERN_CUTOUT (a 2D
	// pattern extruded through the mesh -- glass-pane spiderweb cracks, brick
	// walls, anything with a real authored break-up shape). Unlike the other
	// two, NvBlast doesn't generate the Cutout pattern itself -- same as
	// Unreal's own Blast integration (BlastFractureSettingsCutout::Pattern,
	// a plain UTexture2D artists import), it's a grayscale image the caller
	// supplies via p_cutout_pattern; PATTERN_CUTOUT with no pattern set fails
	// the same way Unreal's does with no Pattern texture assigned.
	//
	// Pattern authoring rule, found the hard way: every crack line must
	// reach the image boundary. A pattern whose lines stop short (e.g. a
	// spiderweb with cracks that fade out before the edge) leaves one
	// single connected "background" region wrapping the whole pattern with
	// a hole in the middle -- unlike a real broken-glass pane, where every
	// shard is a closed polygon. That topology crashed two different ways
	// deep in the SDK's own Cutout code (FractureToolImpl::cutout's
	// SweepingAccelerator construction), not this module's integration --
	// confirmed by testing the exact same pattern with lines extended to
	// the edge, which fractures and fully verifies clean. A straight grid/
	// brick pattern is naturally edge-to-edge already and was never
	// affected; only curved/radial patterns are at risk of this if authored
	// with cracks that stop short.
