// technique with the MPM block-sparse fluid grid (see gas_block_inc.glsl for
// the full design writeup) but the field is persistent -- advected and
// diffused in place across steps -- rather than rebuilt from particles every
// substep. v1 scope (see gas_block_inc.glsl header): the box's lateral (X/Z)
// footprint is fixed at configure() -- only its height grows automatically
// (see _grow_if_needed), up to 3x the configured height -- no pressure
// projection, up to MAX_COLLIDERS sphere colliders.
//
// Owns a private local RenderingDevice and runs fully synchronously (submit +
// sync every dispatch) -- simpler than the MPM fluid solver's shared-device /
// render-thread / async-readback machinery, at the cost of not overlapping
// with the main render thread's own GPU work. A reasonable place to start;
// revisit if this solver needs the same treatment MPM's Stage A/B did.
