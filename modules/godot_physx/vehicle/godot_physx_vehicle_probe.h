// Runtime-bridge MVP probe for PxVehicle2 (PhysX 5's component-based vehicle
// SDK), not a real node -- exists purely so a headless GDScript test can drive
// a real 4-wheel direct-drive vehicle end to end, same precedent as
// GodotPhysXBlastProbe from the Blast work: prove the mechanism cheaply
// before building the real PhysXVehicle3D node. Owns its own PxRigidDynamic
// chassis directly (via PxVehiclePhysXActorCreate), not a GodotPhysXBody3D --
// PxVehicle2's PxVehiclePhysXActorEndComponent writes wheel-shape local poses
// and rigid-body momentum straight onto the actor every tick, which needs raw
// actor/shape pointers, not the generic PhysicsServer3D RID abstraction.
