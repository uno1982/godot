// iWave-style local ripple layer (Tessendorf's damped 2D wave equation),
// reflecting (clamped/Neumann) walls at the grid edge, plus sphere/impulse
// body-disturbance coupling -- port of caustic-volume's `ripple` shader
// (sandbox/src/10_sim.js), simplified for Phase 1. This alone IS the water
// height for now (WATER_LEVEL + this layer's h); Phase 2 composes it with
// the FFT ocean spectrum layer instead of standing in for the whole surface.
//
// Written flat -- no helper functions beyond simple, non-recursive, single-
// call-site ones -- deliberately, per this session's own hard-won lesson
// about a heavily-inlined branchy helper hanging the Blackwell driver's PSO
// compiler in a completely different shader (mpm_bs_march.glsl). This
// shader's real cost is O(GRID_N^2) with a small constant-time body per
// cell (one 5-point Laplacian, a short loop over active spheres/impulses),
// not a deep inlined call chain -- a different risk shape, but keep it that
// way as MAX_SPHERES/MAX_IMPULSES grow.
